To run the code, download the data file spotify-popularity-songs.zip from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmadrazakashif/spotify-popularity-songs. 
Unzip the file and place spotify_songs.csv in the same folder as your Jupyter notebook. In the code, you can then load the data with pd.read_csv('spotify_songs.csv').
